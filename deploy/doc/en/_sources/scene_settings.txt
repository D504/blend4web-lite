.. image:: src_images/scene_settings/scene_object_clustering.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

*Cluster Size*
    The size of the cluster used for batching (in meters). Can be used for optimization purposes. If this parameter is set to zero, the engine will try to combine all objects in the scene. Set to zero by default.

*LOD Cluster Size Multiplier*
    This parameter is used to subdivide clusters (based on LOD distance specified individually for each object) into smaller ones to make transitions between different levels of detail less noticeable. The size of that smaller clusters is defined by object LOD distance multiplied by the value of this parameter. Higher values lead to bigger clusters which increases performance but makes transition between LODs more noticeable, while lower values make said transitions less noticeable at the cost of decreased performance. Can be used for optimization purposes. Set to 0.5 by default.

*LOD Smooth Transitions* 
    Defines what objects will use smooth transitions while switching their LOD levels. Has the following options:

    * OFF - smooth transitions are disabled (fastest).
    * NON-OPAQUE - use smooth transitions for objects with ``Add``, ``Alpha Clip``, ``Alpha Blend``, ``Alpha Sort`` and ``Alpha Anti-Aliasing`` :ref:`materials <alpha_blend>`.
    * ALL - smooth transitions will be used for all objects (slowest).

    Choosing the "ALL" value can noticeably decrease application performance, so use it with caution. Default value is "NON-OPAQUE".

*Max LOD Hysteresis Interval*

    The length of the interval (in meters) used for switching LOD levels. The half of this value is added/subtracted from the distance threshold in order to make two different thresholds for switching to the lower and to the higher LOD level. This should reduce LOD "popping" effect. Set to 4.0 by default.

.. _scene_objects_selection:
