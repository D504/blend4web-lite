Application Development
=======================

To simplify development process, we recommend to use :ref:`Project Manager <project_management>`. It can be used to quickly :ref:`create <create_new_project>` a simple application with a generic code that is enough to load a simple scene and enable basic camera controls.

.. _app_init_loading:

Application Code Structure
--------------------------

The process of initializing and loading an application is separated into several stages, which is reflected in the code of the application. If you are using Project Manager, a newly created ``Copy`` or ``Compile`` type project will include a main JS file, which will be placed in the SDK. The path to the file will look like this: ``./projects/PROJECT_NAME/PROJECT_NAME.js``.

This file contains generic code shaped as a module. This module can be registered using the certain structure:

.. code-block:: javascript

    b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

        // module code
        //...

    });

So, the code of a module is contained within a function that accepts ``exports`` and ``require`` parameters.

#. ``require`` is the method used for loading engine modules. The generic example mentioned above loads several modules:

    The most important ones of them are the ``app`` and ``data`` modules. The ``app`` module simplifies application initialization while the ``data`` module contains API methods for loading 3D scene data.

    .. note::

        To make module naming more convenient, ``m_`` prefix is often used (``m_app``, ``m_data`` etc.) to show that the variable is an engine module.

#. ``exports`` is an object used for gaining access to module’s functions from outside (for example, from other modules). In this case, only the ``init`` function has been made external:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

            ...

            exports.init = function() {
                m_app.init({
                canvas_container_id: "main_canvas_container",
                callback: init_cb,
                show_fps: DEBUG,
                console_verbose: DEBUG,
                autoresize: true
            });
        }

        ...
        });

Application initialization begins with this function, and it is called outside of the module:

.. code-block:: javascript

     b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

         ...

         exports.init = function() {
             m_app.init({
                 canvas_container_id: "main_canvas_container",
                 callback: init_cb,
                 show_fps: DEBUG,
                 console_verbose: DEBUG,
                 autoresize: true
             });
         }

         ...
     });

     // import the app module and start the app by calling the init method
     b4w.require("my_module").init();

After this, the :b4wref:`app.init app.init` method is called. It creates Canvas HTML element and performs all necessary action for initializing WebGL. This method has many different attributes, the most important ones of which are:

* ``canvas_container_id`` set the id of the HTML element that acts as a container for the Canvas element. By default, an element with the ``main_canvas_container`` ID is used (this element is located in the main HTML file of the application).

* ``callback`` is the function that is called after finishing initialization.

When application initialization is completed, the :b4wref:`init_cb app.~AppInitCallback` function set by the ``callback`` parameter is called:

.. code-block:: javascript

    function init_cb(canvas_elem, success) {

        if (!success) {
            console.log("b4w init failure");
            return;
        }

        m_preloader.create_preloader();

        // ignore right-click on the canvas element
        canvas_elem.oncontextmenu = function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopPropagation();
            return false;
        };

       load();
    }

It has following parameters:

* canvas_elem is the created Canvas HTML element that will be used for rendering 3D content

* success it the flag that indicates the success of the initialization. The ``false`` value meant that the application is unable to work due to initialization errors (for example, WebGL is not supported by the device).

.. note::

    The :b4wref:`app.init app.init` methods sets initialization to the ``window.onload`` event, so the ``init_cb`` function will have access to the entire DOM tree of the HTML document.

Now we can begin loading 3D scene. This is done in the ``load`` function that is called from the ``init_cb``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var APP_ASSETS_PATH = m_cfg.get_assets_path("my_project");

    ...

    function load() {
        m_data.load(APP_ASSETS_PATH + "my_project.json", load_cb, preloader_cb);
    }

The :b4wref:`data.load data.load` method is used for loading. The first parameter of this method is the path to a 3D scene file. The path to a JSON file should be relative to the main HTML application file. Projects created in Project Manager have a dedicated asset folder, and you can easily obtain the path to it. This is done in the generic example code by introducing the ``APP_ASSETS_PATH`` global variable that is later used in the :b4wref:`data.load data.load`.

The second parameter of the method is the :b4wref:`load_cb data.~LoadedCallback` function which is called after the 3D scene is loaded and prepared for rendering.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function load() {
        m_data.load(APP_ASSETS_PATH + "my_project.json", load_cb, preloader_cb);
    }

    function load_cb(data_id, success) {

        if (!success) {
            console.log("b4w load failure");
            return;
        }

        m_app.enable_camera_controls();

        // place your code here

    }

Calling this function means that the application has finished loading and now starts scene rendering. As this is the very first moment when the 3D scene data will be available, it is a suitable moment for initializing and preparing everything related to the scene, its object, animations and other things. For example, standard camera controls can be enabled here with the :b4wref:`app.enable_camera_controls` method.

Writing Application Logic
.........................

After initializing and loading 3D scene the application will proceed to work according to the logic set by the programmer such as interacting with input devices, manipulating scene objects, controlling camera behavior and so on.

By observing the :ref:`application loading process <app_init_loading>`, we can determine several places suitable for performing various tasks.

#. The :b4wref:`app.init app.init` method used for starting the initialization accepts engine configuration parameters. So you can configure the engine right before calling this method using URL attributes as a base:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

        ...

        exports.init = function() {
            var url_params = m_app.get_url_params();
            if (url_params && "show_fps" in url_params)
                var show_fps = true;
            else
                var show_fps = false;

            m_app.init({
                canvas_container_id: "main_canvas_container",
                callback: init_cb,
                autoresize: true
                show_fps: show_fps
            });
        }

            ...
        });
        b4w.require("my_module").init();

#. Initialization is started by the ``window.onload`` action, which means that after it is completed, the :b4wref:`init_cb app.~AppInitCallback` function will have access to the whole DOM tree. At this moment, you already can perform some preparations such as creating and setting up interface elements. However, the 3D scene itself is not yet loaded, and its objects are not yet available.

#. After the 3D scene is loaded, the :b4wref:`load_cb data.~LoadedCallback` function is called. At this moment, all scene objects become available, thus any action that concerns them can be implemented in this function. Some examples can be found in the  :ref:`Code Snippets <code_snippets>` application.

Logic can be added to the application by using either browser or engine API:

#. Basic keyboard/mouse/gamepad input can be implemented with standard event handlers by using the ``addEventListener`` method. In more complex cases you can use the :b4wmod:`input` API module. The engine also features the :b4wref:`input.add_click_listener` method that registers both mouse clicks and touch screen events which makes it useful for writing applications compatible with desktop and mobile devices alike.

#. Time-stretched events that have to be performed at every frame (procedural animation, for example) can be implemented with methods such as :b4wref:`main.set_render_callback`, :b4wref:`main.append_loop_cb`, :b4wref:`time.animate` and :b4wref:`time.set_timeout`. Standard ``setTimeout`` and ``setInterval`` methods can also be used.

#. For complex logic that takes into account both user actions and the state of the 3D scene can use engine’s :ref:`event-driven model <event_model>` that is based on sensor system.

Module System
.............

Blend4Web engine is built upon modular structure: all engine API methods are separated into several modules. If necessary, a module can be plugged into the application with the ``require`` method. We recommend to structure the code of the actual application into modules as well.

1) Registering Modules

A module is essentially a code block wrapped by a specific structure that is used to register it:

.. code-block:: javascript

    b4w.register("my_module1", function(exports, require) {

        // module code
        ...
    });

    b4w.register("my_module2", function(exports, require) {

        // module code
        ...
    });

    ...

The :b4wref:`b4w.register` method is used for registering modules. You can only register custom modules if their names do not coincide with the regular API modules. If necessary, the :b4wref:`b4w.module_check` method to check if a module with a given name is present:

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (b4w.module_check("my_module"))
        throw "Failed to register module: my_module";

    b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

        // module code
        ...

    });

2) Loading Modules

Custom modules, just like regular ones, can be plugged in with the ``require`` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

    b4w.register("my_module1", function(exports, require) {

        var mod2 = require("my_module2")

        ...
    });

3) Application Initialization

Application initialization in Blend4Web is usually done with a call like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    b4w.require("my_module").init();

Here, the ``my_module`` custom module and its ``init`` external function do, in a certain sense, act as the entry point to the application.

.. note::

    In the global visibility scope a module can be loaded with the same :b4wref:`b4w.require` method available as a method of the global ``b4w`` object: ``b4w.require("MODULE_NAME")``.

4) Using Multiple Modules

After a project is created in the :ref:`Project Manager <project_management>`, its generic application JS-file will contain only one module. However, while developing the application, you might need to separate your code into several logic parts. In this case, you can either create several modules inside one file, or you can create several files each one of them contain one module.

If your application uses multiple modules, keep in mind that every one of them should be properly registered before initialization starts, or you will get an engine error if you try to call a module that is not yet registered. If you are using several JS files, the script that starts the initialization (contains application entry point) should the last one to be plugged into the main HTML application file.

Background Transparency
=======================

The ``background_color`` and ``alpha`` parameters are passed to the :b4wref:`m_app.init` method placed in the load callback function (a function that is called right after the scene is loaded), like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    m_app.init ({
        alpha: true,
        background_color: [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1]
       //this method sets the background to an opaque light gray color
    });

The combination of the parameters passed to the method defines how the backgrounds of the Blend4Web application and the HTML application blend together. Available options are:

1. ``alpha`` = false
	The color of the background is defined by the ``background_color`` of the Blend4Web application, the background of the HTML application is not taken into consideration.

.. image:: src_images/developers/developers_background_opaque.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

2. ``alpha`` = true
	The background of the HTML application might influence the background of the Blend4Web application based on its transparency which is defined by the fourth component of the ``background_color`` parameter (``alpha`` = ``background_color[3]``, not to be confused with the ``alpha`` parameter mentioned above).

	background_color[3] = 1
		This produces the same result as if the alpha parameter has been turned off (``alpha`` = false)

	background_color[3] = 0
		Additive blending is used.

                .. image:: src_images/developers/developers_background_add.png
                   :align: center
                   :width: 100%

                Picture above shows an HTML page containing a Blend4Web application with a blue [0, 0, 1] background that blends with the page's red (``Red``) color producing a violet tone.

	background_color[3] > 0
		Additive blending is used with the ``background_color`` having a greater influence.

                .. image:: src_images/developers/developers_background_semiopaque.png
                   :align: center
                   :width: 100%

                This picture shows the same HTML page with the same Blend4Web app, however, the ``alpha`` value is set to 0.5, leading to a darker tone of the application background.

The mechanisms of alpha lending are described in greater detail in the :ref:`Color Management <alpha_compositing>` chapter.

By default, the ``alpha`` parameter is set to true and the ``background_color`` is set to transparent black [0, 0, 0, 0], which means that the application will have an HTML background with no influences from the background of the Blend4Web application.

Background transparency can also be utilized in :ref:`Web Player applications <web_player_app>` by using the ``alpha`` :ref:`URL attribute <webplayer_attributes>`. To use this feature, firstly you need to enable the ``Background transparency (alpha)`` parameter in the :ref:`Web Player Params <web_player_params>` group while creating the application.

If Blend4Web application uses sky rendering, the application canvas will be fully covered by objects (including sky), so the background will be fully opaque and not influenced by alpha settings.

.. note::
    Sky rendering is enabled by default in Blend4Web scenes created in :ref:`Project Manager <project_management>`. Don't forget, in order to use a transparent background you will need to manually disable sky rendering.


.. _converter:

Resource Conversion
===================

Currently, browsers do not fully support all possible media formats, so in order to create cross-browser applications (and also for optimization purposes) we recommend you to use the resource converter.

To support a wider range of platforms, a Python script (*scripts/converter.py*) for converting the source files into other formats is included into the distribution.

There are two ways to run this script.

Firstly, you can run it automatically using the project management system. The ``Convert Resources`` button can be found in the main page of the :ref:`Project Manager <project_management>`, in the ``Operations`` tab at the right side of the screen. 

.. image:: src_images/developers/developers_convert_resources.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

Secondly, you can run the script manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    > cd <path_to_sdk>/scripts
    > python3 converter.py [options] resize_textures | convert_dds | convert_media

For MS Windows users:

.. code-block:: console
    
    cd <path_to_sdk>\scripts
    python converter.py [options] resize_textures | convert_dds | convert_media

.. note::

    To run the scripts the Python 3.x needs to be installed in your system.

With the -d parameter you can specify the path to a directory in which converting will take place.

To exclude some directory from resource conversion, it is enough to put a file named ``.b4w_no_conv`` in it. This will not affect conversion in nested directories.

The **resize_textures** argument is used for decreasing texture resolution for the **LOW** mode.

.. _converter_commands:

Commands
--------

Commands for conversion:

* ``resize_textures`` converts textures to lower resolution.

* ``convert_dds`` converts textures to :ref:`DDS format <dds>`.

* ``convert_pvr`` converts textures to :ref:`PVR format <pvrtc>`.

* ``convert_media`` converts audio and video files to :ref:`alternative formats <converter_data_format>`.

* ``convert_gzip`` generates GZIP-compressed versions of ".json" and ".bin" scene files and ".dds" and ".pvr" textures.

Commands for resource cleanup:

* ``cleanup_textures`` removes low resolution textures generated by the ``resize_textures`` command.

* ``cleanup_dds`` removes DDS texture files generated by the ``convert_dds`` command.

* ``cleanup_pvr`` removes PVR texture files generated by the ``convert_pvr`` command.

* ``cleanup_media`` removes audio and video files in alternative formats that were generated by the ``convert_media`` command.

* ``cleanup_gzip`` removes GZIP-compressed files generated by the ``convert_gzip`` command.

Commands for image compression:

* ``compress_png`` compresses PNG files in order to decrease their size. This option requires OptiPNG tool to be installed and set up in the ``PATH`` environment variable.

Other commands:

* ``check_dependencies`` checks :ref:`converter dependencies <converter_deps>`

.. _converter_arguments:

Arguments
---------

* ``-d``, ``--dir <dir_path>`` enables using an alternative directory to store converted files. The <dir_path> value specifies the path to this directory.

* ``-j``, ``--jobs <jobs>`` specifies the number of jobs (threads) to run simultaneously. If this parameter is set to zero or is not specified, the number will be calculated automatically based on the number of CPUs.

* ``-v``, ``--verbose`` enables outputting more information about files that are being converted. For example, when converting textures into DDS format, the script will show progress percentage for every file that is being converted.

.. _converter_deps:

Dependencies
------------

Please make sure that you have all converter dependencies installed. You can do it with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > python3 <path_to_sdk>/scripts/converter.py check_dependencies

If some program is not installed, the following message will be displayed:

*Couldn't find PROGRAM_NAME.*

**Linux**

The list of dependencies is listed in the following table:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Name                          | Ubuntu 16.04 package          |
|                               |                               |
+===============================+===============================+

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| PVRTC                         | install manually              |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

.. note::

    Linux users can additionally install the package qt-faststart which is used to optimize loading media files.

**Windows**

For MS Windows users it is not necessary to install these packages since they are already present in the SDK.

**macOS**

macOS users can install the `brew <http://www.brew.sh/>`_ package manager first and then install any missing packages.

Before installing packages, install the libpng and libjpeg libraries using these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    > brew install libpng
    > brew install libjpeg

Now you can proceed with installing required dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    > brew install imagemagick
    > brew install --with-theora --with-libvpx --with-fdk-aac ffmpeg

In order to install NVIDIA Texture Tools, clone the repository with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > git clone https://github.com/TriumphLLC/NvidiaTextureTools.git

Now you can build and install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    > cd NvidiaTextureTools
    > ./configure
    > make
    > make install

.. _converter_data_format:

Data Formats
------------

The conversion is performed as follows:

for audio (convert_media):
    * ogg (ogv, oga) -> mp4
    * mp3 -> oga
    * mp4 (m4v, m4a) -> oga
    * webm -> m4a

We recommend to use ``ogg`` as a base format. In this case the only conversion required for cross-browser compatibility will be ``ogg`` to ``mp4``. Example of an input file: ``file_name.ogg``, example of an output file: ``file_name.altconv.mp4``.

for video (convert_media):
    * ogg (ogv, oga) -> m4v / seq
    * mp3 -> webm / seq
    * mp4 (m4v, m4a) -> webm / seq
    * webm -> m4v / seq

We recommend to use ``WebM`` as a base format. In this case the only conversion required for cross-browser compatibility will be ``webm`` to ``m4v`` (``webm`` to ``seq`` for iPhone). Example of an input file: ``file_name.webm``, example of an output file: ``file_name.altconv.m4v``.

for images (convert_dds):
    * png -> dds/pvr
    * jpg -> dds/pvr
    * bmp -> dds/pvr
    * gif -> dds

Example of an input file: ``file_name.jpg``, example of an output file: ``file_name.altconv.jpg.dds``.

For the purpose of optimizing application performance it's possible to use ``min50`` (halved) and ``DDS`` or ``PVRTC`` (compressed) textures. In order to do this, we need to pass the following parameters during initialization of the application:

.. code-block:: javascript

    exports.init = function() {
        m_app.init({
            // . . .
            assets_dds_available: true,
            assets_min50_available: true,
            // . . .
        });
        // . . .
    }

.. note::
    If you are planning to use textures compressed into :ref:`PVRTC <pvrtc>` format, then replace this line of code

     .. code-block:: javascript

         assets_dds_available: true,

    with the following:

     .. code-block:: javascript

         assets_pvr_available: true,

    This will tell the engine to load PVRTC textures, if such are present in the ``./assets/`` folder.

.. _dds:

DDS Texture Compression
.......................

``DDS`` textures require less memory (4 times less for ``RGBA`` data and 6 times for ``RGB`` data), but using them has following downsides:

    * ``DDS`` textures might not work on some devices, especially the mobile ones, as not all of them support the ``WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc`` extension;

    * as ``DDS`` is a lossy compression format, compression artifacts might be visible, especially on :ref:`normal <normal_map>` and :ref:`stencil <stencil_map>` maps; it is recommended to :ref:`disable compression <texture_disable_compression>` for such textures.

    .. image:: src_images/developers/compression_artifacts.png
        :align: center
        :width: 100%

    An example of the ``DDS`` compression artifacts, particularly visible on the edges of the shadow.

During exporting the scene from Blender to the ``JSON`` format (but not the ``HTML`` format), ``DDS`` textures will be plugged in automatically, if they are present.

Textures can be converted to the ``DDS`` format using the :ref:`project manger <project_management>` or the *scripts/converter.py* script described above.

.. _pvrtc:

PVRTC Texture Compression
.........................

``PVRTC`` is another texture compression format used primarily on iOS devices. In some cases it can produce texture files up to two times smaller than same texture images would take in ``DDS`` format.

The format has two compression settings that are supported by the engine: 2-bpp (two bits per pixel) and 4-bpp (four bits per pixel).

As with ``DDS`` format, textures compressed using the ``PVRTC`` algorithm may not work on some platforms, especially mobile, because using this compression format require support for the ``IMG_texture_compression_pvrtc`` WebGL extension.

The PVRTC library and SDK are available for Windows, Linux and macOS systems alike. Installation packages can be downloaded from the `Power VR Insider <https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/>`_ web page.

The Blend4Web engine uses a console PVRTC tool. To use it, you need to add the path to it to the ``PATH`` environmental variable, like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH = <InstallDir>\PVRTexTool\CLI\<PLATFORM>\

where <InstallDir> is the PVRTexTool installation directory and <PLATFORM> is a folder that contains the version of the tool that corresponds to your OS, for example, ``\Windows_x86_64\`` for 64-bit Windows OS.

.. note::
    In Windows systems, environment variables can be set in the ``System`` (in Windows 10 and 8) or ``Properties`` (in Windows 7 and Vista) dialogue window by choosing ``Advanced System Settings`` -> ``Environment Variables``, or by using console commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        SET PATH = <InstallDir>\PVRTexTool\CLI\<PLATFORM>\

After this, you will be able to convert the textures to the PVR format by using converter.py script with the ``convert_dds`` command.

.. _seq:

SEQ Video Format
................

The ``.seq`` file format is used for sequential video. This is applied for IE 11 and iPhone because they are currently missing support for standard video formats for textures. Using dds format for images is more optimal compared to other formats.

The engine can use files which are manually created by a user if they have the following names: ``file_name.altconv.m4v``, ``file_name.altconv.mp3`` and so on. Such files should be placed in the same directory as the media files used in Blender.

You can also use the free and cross-platform application `Miro Video Converter <http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/>`_ to convert media files.

.. _gzip:

GZIP Compression
================

Typical Blend4Web application can use various resource formats from standard  HTML, JS, CSS, PNG or JPEG files to engine-specific JSON- and BIN-files that contain scene data. Compressed  DDS/PVR image formats are also an option. Both big and small applications benefit from decreasing the size of the resources, as this also decreases the loading time.

Usually, loading time can be decreased by setting up caching on the server that contains web application. You can also enable GZIP compression for various file types.

Speaking of the specific file types, GZIP compression should be used for  JSON, BIN, DDS and PVR files. JSON and BIN files, being the main scene files, can contain large amounts of data, while DDS and PVR also can be quite large (at least when compared to standard PNG and JPEG files), and there can be quite a lot of them.

But if for some reason GZIP compression cannot be set up on the server, it can be enabled in the application itself.

The engine can load compressed resources in the form of ``.gz`` files. To use this feature in a ``WebPlayer JSON`` type project, you need to pass the ``compressed_gzip`` URL parameter. If you are developing your own application, you need to pass the ``assets_gzip_available`` configuration parameter during the initialization.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var m_app = require("app");

        m_app.init({
            canvas_container_id: "main_canvas_container",
            callback: init_cb,
            show_fps: DEBUG,
            console_verbose: DEBUG,
            autoresize: true,
            assets_gzip_available: true
        });

Compressed ``.gz`` files should be placed alongside the original ones, for example, like this:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        my_project/
            assets/
                my_scene.json
                my_scene.json.gz
                my_scene.bin
                my_scene.bin.gz

This also applies to the ``.dds`` and ``.pvr`` files and their compressed counterparts ``.dds.gz`` and ``.pvr.gz``.

.. note::

    If a compressed ``.gz`` is not present, engine will load the original file and output a corresponding message to the console.

GZIP compressed files can be generated with the ``convert resources`` :ref:`command <project_manager>` that can be found in the Project Manager interface. This can also be done in the console by running the :ref:`./scripts/converter.py <converter>` script with the ``compress_gzip`` (for compressing resources) or the ``cleanup_gzip`` (for removing compressed files) command.

.. _code_snippets:

Code Examples
=============

The SDK includes the Code Snippets application which demonstrates how to use the engine's functionality.

Currently, this application contains the following examples:

    * Bone API - an example of individual bones position control
    * Camera Animation - procedural camera animation
    * Camera Move Styles - changing control modes for the camera
    * Canvas Texture - working with canvas textures
    * Change Image - changing texture images on-the-fly
    * Custom Anchors - creating custom annotations
    * Dynamic Geometry - procedural geometry modification
    * Gamepad - an example of controlling a character via gamepad
    * Gyro (Mobile Only) - working with mobile devices' gyroscopes
    * Instancing - copying scene objects in runtime
    * Leap Motion - an example of using Leap Motion controller
    * Lines - procedural lines rendering
    * Material API - tweaking material properties and replacing objects' materials
    * Morphing - using shape keys
    * Multitouch (Mobile Only) - using mobile devices multitouch sensor
    * Pathfinding - an example of calculating paths and using navigation meshes
    * Ray Test - the usage of raycasting for obstacles detection
    * VR - a VR application example
    * Webcam - using media stream from a web camera

The Code Snippets application is available at ``./apps_dev/code_snippets/code_snippets_dev.html``. It can be also run by using a link in the ``index.html`` file located in the SDK root.


Loading Application Assets
==========================

To simplify project maintenance and server deployment always keep your application asset files (exported scenes, textures, sounds, etc) separate from other project files (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc). Inside your SDK this asset directory is located at ``projects/my_project/assets``.

To load files (e.g by using :b4wref:`data.load()`) from this directory use the :b4wref:`config.get_assets_path()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

    m_data.load(m_config.get_assets_path("my_project") + "loaded_scene.json", load_cb);

This way you ensure that your applications will find assets independently of the current development stage (developed, built or deployed).

.. _event_model:

Event-Driven Model
==================

The event-driven model provides a universal interface for describing the 3D scene's change of state. It simplifies the processing of physics events and user actions.

.. index:: sensor

Sensors
-------

The basic unit of the event-driven model is a sensor. A sensor is a programming entity and can only be active (1, one) or inactive (0, zero). Some sensors may carry a payload which can be received in the manifold's callback function with corresponding API. For example, the ray-tracing sensor (Ray Sensor) provides the relative length of the intersection ray.

.. index:: sensor; manifold

Users cannot directly control sensors via the external API. Instead, all sensors must be present in one or multiple collections - so called sensor manifolds. A manifold is a logic container associated with a scene object. It generates a response to a defined set of sensor events by executing a callback function. To define the manifold it is required to have the following information (see also the API documentation for description of the ``controls.create_sensor_manifold`` function):

* An object to carry the manifold (e.g. a thrown object).
* A unique id of the manifold (e.g. "IMPACT").
* Callback execution mode (the options are: ``CT_POSITIVE`` - logic function positive result, ``CT_CONTINUOUS`` - every frame with a positive logic function result and once with a zero result, ``CT_LEVEL`` - any logic, function result change, ``CT_SHOT`` - one-stage logic function result change, ``CT_TRIGGER`` - logic function result switch, ``CT_CHANGE`` - any sensor value change).
* An array of sensors.
* A logic function to define the combination of the sensor states for which the callback function is executed.
* A callback function.
* An optional parameter to pass into the callback function.

You can read more about engine API in the :b4wmod:`controls` module documentation.

Example
-------

Let's consider the task to insonify the impact of a thrown stone. A distinctive sound should be produced for impacting different media (for example terrain and wall). There are collision meshes with physical materials in the Blender scene, material ids are "TERRAIN" and "WALL". There is also a physical object being thrown in the scene, the object is named "Stone".


Let's define a collision sensor for each medium, by the type of the sound produced.


.. code-block:: javascript

    // import the modules
    var m_scenes = b4w.require("scenes");
    var m_controls = b4w.require("controls");

    // get the object being thrown
    var stone = m_scenes.get_object_by_name("Stone");

    // create the sensors
    var sensor_impact_terrain = m_controls.create_collision_sensor(stone, "TERRAIN");
    var sensor_impact_wall    = m_controls.create_collision_sensor(stone, "WALL");



Add the sensors into an array. Use the ``OR`` logic in the logic function. Place the sound processing code in the callback function. Create the sensor manifold with the "IMPACT" id and the ``CT_SHOT`` type.


.. code-block:: javascript

    // array of the sensors
    var impact_sens_array = [sensor_impact_terrain, sensor_impact_wall];

    // manifold logic function
    var impact_sens_logic = function(s) {return (s[0] || s[1])};

    // callback
    var impact_cb = function(obj, manifold_id, pulse) {

        // NOTE: it's possible to play both sounds simultaneously 
        
        if (m_controls.get_sensor_value(obj, manifold_id, 0) == 1) {
            // ...
            console.log("play the terrain impact sound");
        }
                
        if (m_controls.get_sensor_value(obj, manifold_id, 1) == 1) {
            // ...
            console.log("play the wall impact sound");
        }
    }

    // create the manifold
    m_controls.create_sensor_manifold(stone, "IMPACT", m_controls.CT_SHOT,
        impact_sens_array, impact_sens_logic, impact_cb);


When the "Stone" object collides with any physical material of "TERRAIN" or "WALL", the callback function is executed. Inside this function we get the values of both sensors by their indices in the sensor array (0 - "TERRAIN", 1 - "WALL"). The sensor value = 1 (active) means that the collision happened with the corresponding physical material. As a result the corresponding sound is produced (the code is not shown).

.. _browser_for_local_loading:

Loading Local Resources
=======================

The engine's renderer is a web application and it works when you view an HTML file in a browser. After initialization the resources (scenes, textures) are loaded. This process is subject to the `same-origin policy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy>`_ rule. In particular this rule forbids loading from a local directory.

Since version 15.02, the Blend4Web SDK includes the :ref:`development server <local_development_server>` to solve the problem of loading local resources.


.. _quality_settings:

Quality Profiles
================

Several quality profiles are implemented in order to support platforms with different functionality.

    * *low quality* (``P_LOW``) - a range of functions is turned off (such as shadows, dynamic reflection, postprocessing), the size of textures is halved when using a release version, anti-aliasing is disabled
    * *high quality* (``P_HIGH``) - all features requested by the scene are used, the anti-aliasing method is FXAA
    * *maximum quality* (``P_ULTRA``) - rendering resolution is doubled, resolution of shadow maps is increased, the anti-aliasing method is FXAA (uses higher quality settings and works slower).
    * *custom quality* (``P_CUSTOM``) - any quality parameter can be set to any possible value. This option is used when you need to set certain quality parameters manually. By default, it uses the same settings as ``High`` quality profile.


.. image:: src_images/developers/developers_quality.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

Switching the quality profiles can be performed in runtime before initialization of the WebGL context. The default profile is ``P_HIGH``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
    var m_main = b4w.require("main");

    m_cfg.set("quality", m_cfg.P_LOW);
    m_main.init(...);


Application developers can also set the **quality** parameter upon engine initialization using the ``app.js`` add-on:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
    var m_app = b4w.require("app");

    m_app.init({
        canvas_container_id: "body_id",
        quality: m_cfg.P_HIGH
    });
    

.. _non_standard_canvas_pos:

Non-Standard Canvas Position and Orientation
============================================

The Canvas element, to which the rendering is performed, can change its position relative to the browser window. This can occur due to some manipulations over the DOM tree, or as a result of page scrolling which is especially relevant for non-fullscreen web applications.

In most cases this will not affect the performance of the app by any means. However, some DOM events related to mouse cursor or touch position may carry incorrect information. This occurs because the coordinates obtained from the corresponding events are measured relative to the origin of the browser window, while the engine works with the coordinate space of the Canvas element itself (its origin is located in the top left corner).

1) If the top left corner of the Canvas element matches the top left corner of the browser window and is fixed in its position (non-movable) then it's sufficient to use event.clientX and event.clientY coordinates of the input events or :b4wref:`mouse.get_coords_x()` and :b4wref:`mouse.get_coords_y()` methods.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var m_mouse = require("mouse");

    // . . .
    var x = event.clientX;
    var y = event.clientY;
    // . . .
    var x = m_mouse.get_coords_x(event);
    var y = m_mouse.get_coords_y(event);
    // . . .

|

2) In the case of more sophisticated manipulations with the Canvas element (scrolling of the page elements, displacement from the top level corner of the browser window, changes in the DOM-tree) it's needed to obtain properly calculated coordinates. This can be done by using the aforementioned :b4wref:`mouse.get_coords_x()` and :b4wref:`mouse.get_coords_y()` methods with a ``true`` value as a third parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var m_mouse = require("mouse");

    // . . .
    var x = m_mouse.get_coords_x(event, false, true);
    var y = m_mouse.get_coords_y(event, false, true);
    // . . .

|

Another option in this case is to use the :b4wref:`container.client_to_canvas_coords()` method as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var m_cont = require("container");

    var _vec2_tmp = new Float32Array(2);

    // . . .
    var coords_xy = m_cont.client_to_canvas_coords(event.clientX, event.clientY, _vec2_tmp);
    // . . .

.. _mobile_web_apps:

Mobile Web Apps
===============

An option to scale the whole webpage and change the orientation of a mobile device should be considered when creating user interface for a web application. It is recommended to prevent scaling and keep the aspect ratio of a webpage constant to avoid possible problems. This can be achieved by adding the following meta-tag to the page header:

.. code-block:: html

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">

Sometimes you might need to lock a mobile device to a certain orientation, especially when you don't want to make both landscape and portrait interface variants. Since the native screenlock API is experimental and isn't widespread, this might be easier to do using CSS rules.

To keep the orientation in landscape mode only, one can set rotation for the <html> element by 90 degrees in the portrait mode:

.. code-block:: css

    @media (orientation : portrait) {
        html {
            position: absolute;
            width: 100vh;
            height: 100vw;
            overflow: hidden;

            -moz-transform: rotate(90deg);
            -ms-transform: rotate(90deg);
            -webkit-transform: rotate(90deg);
            transform: rotate(90deg);
            -moz-transform-origin: top left;
            -ms-transform-origin: top left;
            -webkit-transform-origin: top left;
            transform-origin: top left;

            left: 100%;
        }
    }

|

Similarly, the CSS rule for the portrait mode only should look like the following:

.. code-block:: css

    @media (orientation : landscape) {
        html {
            position: absolute;
            width: 100vh;
            height: 100vw;
            overflow: hidden;

            -moz-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -ms-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -moz-transform-origin: top left;
            -ms-transform-origin: top left;
            -webkit-transform-origin: top left;
            transform-origin: top left;

            top: 100%;
        }
    }
