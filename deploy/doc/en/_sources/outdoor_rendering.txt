Blend4Web has several environmental effects that can be useful for creating outdoor scenes.

.. _water:

Water
=====

Activation
----------

For the supposed water material activate the ``Water`` panel option under the ``Material`` tab.

   :width: 100%

Basic Settings
--------------

*Transparency*
    It is recommended to enable the gradient transparency (set the ``Transparency > Type`` parameter to the ``Alpha Blend`` value) and to tweak the ``Alpha`` value. 

*Lighting parameters*
    Lighting parameters for the water material can be set up as described in the :ref:`material_lighting_params` section.

Waves Dynamics
--------------

Ripples on the water are simulated by normal maps with animated UVs (from 0 up to 4 pieces). For normal map the only shared image is used - the textures differs only by the ``Mapping > Size`` parameters. The water mesh must have a UV layer.
   
Surface Wetting
---------------

Is carried out automatically. To turn the effect on activate the ``Wettable`` option on the needed materials ``Rendering Options`` panel.


Reflection and Fresnel Effect
-----------------------------

For the water material both static and dynamic reflection is supported as well as the Fresnel effect. See the :ref:`material_mirror` section.

Shoreline Smoothing
-------------------

The effect affects the water near the shoreline - it becomes more transparent.

*Water > Shore Smoothing*
    Enable smoothing.

*Water > Absorb Factor*
    This is the light absorption coefficient for water. The higher it is the more transparent the water is. This value can vary from 0 to 100. The default value is 6.


Color Gradient
--------------
For color gradient the water material must have a texture with the ``Export Options > Shore Distance Map`` option enabled. This texture can be generated using the script for :ref:`baking shoreline parameters <shore_distance_bake>`.

*Shallow Water > Color*
    This sets the color of shallow water. By default, blue (0.008, 0.222, 0.8) is used.

*Shallow Water > Factor*
    This sets the mixing factor for the color of shallow water. This value can vary from 0 to 2, and is set to 1 by default.

*Shore Water > Color*
    This determines the color of the water just at the shore line. By default, dark blue (0.003, 0.19, 0.57) is used.

*Shore Water > Factor*
    This sets the mixing factor for the color of the water just near the shoreline. This value can vary from 0 to 2, and is set to 0.5 by default.

Refraction
----------

Under the ``Render`` tab in the ``Reflections and Refractions`` panel set the ``Refractions`` option to ``ON`` or ``AUTO``.

    Oscillation amplitude of the animated UV coordinates. The default value is (1.0, 1.0).


Setting up the Material
.......................

*Foam > Factor*
    General influence factor for the foam. The default value is 0.5.


Caustics and Chromatic Aberration
---------------------------------

To create the caustics effect turn on the ``Caustics`` option on the water material. Also, there has to be at least one ``Sun`` on the scene.

.. image:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/water_caustics.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

*Scale*
    Cell size for the procedural texture. The default value is 0.25.

*Brightness*
    Caustics influence factor. The default value is 0.5.

Underwater Environment
----------------------

.. image:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/underwater.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

Visibility Settings (“fog”)
...........................

*Underwater Fog > Color*
    Fog color. The default value is (0.4, 0.6, 0.7).

*Underwater Fog > Density*
    Exponential factor which affects the density and visibility distance. The default value is 0.06.

The :ref:`god rays <god_rays>` effect settings are also applied.


.. note::
    The ``Rendering Options > Backface Culling`` option must be turned off for the correct water surface rendering.

.. _water_volumetric_waves:

Volumetric Waves
----------------

Activation
..........

To enable procedural waves the ``Waves`` option must be turned on.

.. note::
    The direction of procedural waves is derived from a ``Wind`` force field in the scene.

    If a scene does not have a ``Wind`` force field, procedural waves will only move in the default direction which cannot be changed.

.. index:: shoreline data, shoreline

.. _shore_distance_bake:

Baking Shoreline Data to Texture
................................

On the tools panel (hotkey “T”) under the ``Blend4Web`` tab open the ``Bake Shore Distance Map`` panel. Set the parameters: maximum distance to shore (``Maximum Distance``) and the resulting texture size (``Texture Size``). Select a landscape object (or multiple objects) first, and then - a water object. Click the ``Bake`` button.
 
Depending on the texture size and the number of vertices in the processed meshes the execution time of the script may vary from a fraction of a second up to several minutes. Make sure that the texture named ``ShoreDistance`` is created for the water mesh.

Upon script execution some system properties are saved in the water material. Therefore, the scene must be saved after the script has finished working. 


.. _atmosphere:

Atmosphere
==========

Scattering
----------

Enable ``World > Render Sky``, then activate ``Procedural Sky`` panel under the World tab. Please note, that if a :ref:`static skydome texture <skydome_texture>` is being used at the same time, it will be replaced.

.. note::

    Also, a procedural sky texture can be used to imitate scattered :ref:`environment lighting <environment_lighting>` similar to the :ref:`static skydome texture <skydome_texture>`. To do this, enable the ``Procedural Sky > Use as Environment Lighting`` and ``Environment Lighting > Sky Texture`` options. If the world texture for environment lighting already exists, it will be replaced.

.. _lens_flare:

Lens Flare
==========

.. image:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/outdoor_rendering_lens_flare_example.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

This feature can be enabled by the ``Lens Flare`` check-box located in the ``Rendering Options`` of the ``Material`` panel.

.. image:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/outdoor_rendering_lens_flare.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

.. note::

    This effect is strongly recommended to use with a single ``Sun`` type light source present in the scene.

Lens Flare Settings
-------------------

Lens Flare Object
-----------------

.. image:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/outdoor_rendering_lens_flare_object.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

Lens Flare object is used for the actual rendering of the effect. In essence, such an object consists of several planes with each plane containing one element of the flare. The normal vector of each plane should be pointed in the ``-Y`` direction. Every element can slide across the screen in relation to camera rotation with the sole exception being the central plane (bright white "star" on the picture above). This plane serves as a center of the lens flare object and should have a *local* ``Y`` coordinate set to 1.

The placement and spatial orientation of the object itself are not taken into account during rendering.

For lens flare object to work correctly, the ``Disable Frustum Culling`` option should be activated.

An example of such object can be seen, for example, in our **Island** demo.

Material Settings
.................

The material used for the lens flare object should have the ``Alpha Blend`` transparency type. ``Alpha`` parameter should be set to zero.

:ref:`Node materials <node_materials>` are not supported.

Texture Settings
................

.. figure:: src_images/outdoor_rendering/outdoor_rendering_lens_texture.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

    An example of texture used to generate Lens Flare effect.

The texture used for the Lens Flare object should contain all elements used to form the shape of the flare in an actual application. The texture image should use ``Alpha`` channel and influence both ``Color`` and ``Alpha`` values.

.. _wind:

Wind
